# VGA Controller that displays an image from FPGA Block RAM
This is a 640x480 VGA controller that displays an image of size 256x256, with each pixel in 256-color (8bits). 
The design is tested on Digilent's Nexys 3 FPGA board.

If you want to change the image, Matlab/Octave code is also shared that scales an image and converts it to hex file that is used to initialize BRAM.
